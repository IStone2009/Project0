For my project 0, I decided to create a sample layout for a professional portfolio I will ineveitably use to showcase my skills.

The index.html is a typical homepage that allows you to navigate to the other html pages through a navbar. 
The navbar is where the majority of the action is happening. I created several class types to change the color on mouse-over and to let the viewer know which page they are on with a static color over it. 
To stylize the page, I combined bootstrap with my own style page. I like black, so I variabled in black using ...

$color: black;

...in order to autofill several backgrounds. I added additional padding to the page as well as borders and thematic colors. 
I liked the idea of shadow, so I included that into the stylesheet.

The list of works page builds on this formatting and introduces a table of shows I've worked on. The Contact page illustrates the UL and form components as well as the grid function for the logos. I used a bootstrap button component labeled "Purposefully Inactive" that I will later use to forward messages to my inbox. The About page contains an image file of me looking rather tired (its my default state).
I hope you enjoy!
